The website is used both outside and internally in the Digital Department in Salling Group to inspire and knowledge share on technology and whatever we find interesting. We have opened up to the public because we want to show what we do and what inspires us.

Furthermore we want feedback on ideas and want to share our knowledge with whomever finds it useful or interesting. Basically we just want the web to be a better place.

## Technology

The platform is build with [ghost](https://ghost.org/).
