# Writing styles

Styles are written using the [SASS preprocessor](http://sass-lang.com/). We are using the SCSS variant.

Besides that [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is used to handle all prefixing of css3.

The Block, Element, Modifier methodology (commonly referred to as BEM) is the naming convention for css classes. Rad about [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/).
